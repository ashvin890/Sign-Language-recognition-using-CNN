Abstract Conversing to a person with hearing disability is always a major challenge. Sign language has indelibly become the ultimate panacea and is a very powerful tool for individuals with hearing and speech disability to communicate their feelings and opinions to the world. It makes the integration process between them and others smooth and less complex. However, the invention of sign language alone, is not enough . There are many strings attached to this boon.The sign gestures often get mixed and confused for someone who has never learnt it or knows it in a different language.

In this paper, we introduce a Sign Language recognition using American Sign Language.
